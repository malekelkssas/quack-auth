# AI.md — quack-auth

Engineering log for AI-assisted work on this repo. Goes beyond disclosure: **session id**, **Cursor surface** (editor vs agents), **model** (full name + version, e.g. **Composer 2.5** — not just “Composer”), prompts, fixes, judgement calls, and **chat summaries**.

## Cursor surface (editor vs agents)

Log which Cursor UI hosted the chat:

| Value      | Meaning                                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Editor** | Cursor **editor** app — inline chat / Composer in the IDE  |
| **Agents** | Cursor **Agents** window — dedicated multi-chat agent runs |

**From now on**, every session entry must include **`Cursor surface`** — `Editor` or `Agents`.

### Setup-first (Developer)

All work logged in this file through session **`S006-quality-gates`** was done in the **Editor** app. The Developer stressed that **initial setup** (monorepo, Husky, CI, DOCS, quality gates) is the **most important** foundation — keep a **close eye** on setup docs, hooks, and `apps/DOCS/docs/setup/` staying accurate as the repo evolves.

The Developer is moving to the **Agents** window next for **multi-chat / multi-branch** work (parallel agents on separate branches). Editor remains fine for focused setup edits; Agents is the preferred surface for parallel feature work.

## Branch per chat

**Every new chat** must start on a dedicated branch:

| Pattern                   | Example               |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `quack-XX-<feature-slug>` | `quack-01-auth-login` |

1. Inspect: `git branch -a | grep quack-`
2. Create: `./scripts/next-quack-branch.sh <feature-slug>` or `git checkout -b quack-XX-<feature>`
3. Log **branch name** in session entries when useful.

`XX` = next zero-padded number. One branch per chat — do not share across agents.

**Commits:** Conventional Commits enforced by commitlint (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`, …). See `apps/DOCS/docs/setup/10-git-branches-commits.md`.

## Session IDs

One id per **chat** — all changes made in the same conversation share the same session id:

| Format            | Example                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `S###-short-slug` | `S001-initial-scaffold`, `S005-docusaurus` |

- Use the **same session id** for every entry logged from the **same chat**.
- Start a **new id** when the Developer opens a **new chat** (even if the topic continues).
- Reference in prompts: `Continuing S005-docusaurus: …`

## Chat summaries

When Cursor **summarizes / compacts** chat context (or you start a new chat with handoff), log it:

1. Note it in the session entry (`**Chat summary** — Yes …`).
2. Add a `### Chat summary — [date time]` block under the active session with what was carried forward and what may need re-reading.

If an agent is working from summarized context, it should say so explicitly at the start of the turn.

## Cursor AI artifacts

| What                     | Path                                     | When to use                                          |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Subagent**             | `.cursor/agents/ai-first-engineering.md` | **Always** for non-trivial work — `/create-subagent` |
| **AI-first rule**        | `.cursor/rules/ai-first-engineering.mdc` | Policy + workflow — should have been `/create-rule`  |
| **Delegation rule**      | `.cursor/rules/ai-first-subagent.mdc`    | Task-tool fallback + "always delegate" rules         |
| **Docusaurus docs rule** | `.cursor/rules/docusaurus-docs.mdc`      | When editing `apps/DOCS/**`                          |
| **Project conventions**  | `.cursor/rules/project-conventions.mdc`  | DTOs, Mongoose layout, paths                         |

Invoke subagent: `Use the ai-first-engineering subagent to [task]`

### Developer mistake: skills instead of rules

The Developer used **`/create-skill`** for project-wide guidance that belongs in **Cursor rules** (`/create-rule`):

- `ai-first-engineering`, `ai-first-subagent`, `docusaurus-docs` were under `.cursor/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- Migrated to `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (this session). Old skill dirs removed.

**Skill ≠ subagent** (earlier fix): first `/create-subagent` pass only added `.cursor/skills/ai-first-subagent/` — a skill, not a subagent. Subagents must live in `.cursor/agents/*.md`. Fixed by adding `.cursor/agents/ai-first-engineering.md`.

## Project summary (so far)

Nx monorepo (`pnpm` + Nx 22) with:

| Area            | What exists                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **FE**          | React + Vite + Tailwind at `apps/FE` (`pnpm nx serve FE` → :4200)                                                              |
| **BE**          | NestJS at `apps/BE` (`pnpm nx serve BE` → :3000/api, Swagger at `/docs`)                                                       |
| **Shared libs** | `libs/qu-constants` (`@shared/constants`), `libs/dtos` (`@shared/dtos`)                                                        |
| **Mongoose**    | Root `mongoose/` — `client.ts`, `models/`, `fixtures/`, planned `seed.ts`                                                      |
| **Env**         | `.env.example` committed; `.env` gitignored; keys in `ENV_KEYS`                                                                |
| **Docker**      | `docker-compose.yml` — MongoDB 8 (`quack_auth_mongodb`)                                                                        |
| **Docs**        | Docusaurus at `apps/DOCS` (`pnpm nx serve DOCS` → :4001)                                                                       |
| **Quality**     | Husky pre-commit — lint-staged (Prettier + ESLint fix) + `pnpm check`                                                          |
| **CI**          | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — `pnpm ci` (check + build); `pr-open-change-summary.yml` — Cursor digest on PR **opened**          |
| **AI surface**  | Sessions through `S006` — **Editor**; from here prefer **Agents** window for parallel work                                     |
| **Conventions** | `AGENTS.md` indexes rules; detail in `.cursor/rules/project-conventions.mdc` (DTOs, Mongoose, paths) and sibling `*.mdc` rules |

### Completed setup steps

1. Nx monorepo init (FE + BE apps)
2. Path aliases — `@/*` per app; shared libs via `baseUrl: "../.."` (FE must extend `./tsconfig.json` for `jsx`)
3. `qu-constants` + `dtos` libs; Zod + nestjs-zod
4. BE: global pipes/interceptors/filters; greeting endpoint `GET /api?name=…`
5. MongoDB deps + env constants + `mongoose/client.ts`
6. Docker Compose for local MongoDB
7. AI policy skill + subagent + this log
8. Docusaurus DOCS app — migrated from root `docs/setup.md`
9. Husky + lint-staged + Prettier + ESLint/typecheck gates (`pnpm check`)
10. Commitlint + `quack-XX-*` branch-per-chat workflow (`scripts/next-quack-branch.sh`)

## 2026-06-08 18:30 — Initial scaffolding & shared libs

**Session** — `S001-initial-scaffold`

**Local start time** — `2026-06-08 18:30`

**Cursor surface** — Editor

**Model** — not recorded (session predates model logging in AI.md)

**Chat summary** — not recorded (early sessions may have had silent compaction)

**Prompts that worked**

- Generate Nx FE/BE apps with `--no-interactive`, document in `docs/setup.md`
- Add shared `qu-constants` / `dtos` with `@shared/*` path aliases from monorepo root
- Wire nestjs-zod (pipe, interceptor, Swagger `cleanupOpenApiDoc`, `app.dto.ts` wrappers)
- MongoDB: `pnpm add @nestjs/mongoose mongoose`, `mongodb-memory-server`, root `mongoose/` layout

**Output that needed fixing**

- **Jest types** — `@types/jest` in package.json but not installed; resolved via `pnpm install`
- **FE tsconfig** — extending `tsconfig.base.json` directly dropped `jsx: "react-jsx"`; fixed by extending `./tsconfig.json`
- **Path aliases** — `baseUrl: "."` + `../../libs/...` duplicated root paths; unified on `baseUrl: "../.."`
- **Schema naming** — `GreetingQuery` as both const and type broke `createZodDto` inference / `query.name`; Developer preferred same-name pattern; kept but documented sync needs
- **ZodSerializationException** — default 500 with no `errors` array; customized `http-exception.filter.ts` to match request validation shape (400 + `errors`)
- **Constants layout** — renamed `qu-constants.ts` → `app.constants.ts`; added `env.constants.ts`, `node-env.constants.ts`
- **`mongoose/client.ts`** — relative imports to lib files; switched to `@shared/constants`
- **Skill vs subagent** — `/create-subagent` initially created only `.cursor/skills/ai-first-subagent/`; real subagent belongs in `.cursor/agents/ai-first-engineering.md`

**Decisions different from AI**

- **Response validation errors as 400** — nestjs-zod treats serialization failures as 500 (server bug); we map them to the same body as input validation for consistent API DX during development
- **Same-name Zod schema + type** — Developer choice over `*Schema` suffix convention
- **Filters directory** — `apps/BE/src/filters/` (`http-exception`, `global-exception`) instead of colocating in `app/`
- **`app.dto.ts` sync warning** in setup — BE needs `createZodDto` wrappers separate from shared Zod schemas in `libs/dtos`; Developer later pointed to [filelinks](https://github.com/Vilancer/filelinks) as the tool being built to link these (not on npm yet)
- **Always-use subagent** — non-trivial work should go through `ai-first-engineering` subagent, not inline parent agent

**Verified**

- [x] `pnpm nx build BE` / `pnpm nx build FE`
- [x] `curl "http://localhost:3000/api?name=world"` → `{ name, appName }`
- [x] `tsc -p mongoose/tsconfig.json --noEmit`
- [x] `tsc -p apps/FE/tsconfig.app.json --noEmit`
- [x] `docker compose config`

## 2026-06-08 — Docusaurus DOCS app (continued in same chat)

**Session** — `S005-docusaurus`

**Local start time** — not recorded at session start

**Cursor surface** — Editor

**Model** — Composer (exact version not recorded for this session)

**Chat summary** — No (single continuous thread for DOCS migration)

**Prompts that worked**

- `pnpm nx g @nx-extend/docusaurus:app DOCS` + relocate to `apps/DOCS`
- Split `docs/setup.md` into `apps/DOCS/docs/setup/01-*.md` … `08-docusaurus.md`
- `docs-maintainer` subagent + `docusaurus-docs` skill

**Verified**

- [x] `pnpm nx build DOCS`

---

## 2026-06-08 — Husky, README, multi-agent prep

**Session** — `S006-quality-gates`

**Local start time** — not recorded at session start

**Cursor surface** — Editor (entire session through CI, PR summary, secrets; Developer next moves to **Agents** for multi-chat/branch work)

**Model** — Composer 2.5

**Chat summary** — Yes — prior thread summarized at handoff; Developer asked to continue Husky + README + CI prep for parallel agent work.

**Developer asked for**

- Set up **Husky** with linting, TypeScript checks, **Prettier**, and auto-fix for fixable linter/Prettier issues on commit
- Update **root README** with a good summary; keep only prerequisites, `pnpm install`, `.env` locally — point everything else to **DOCS**
- Update **skills** with README boundary and quality-gate commands
- **CI next** — Developer explicitly said we will add Husky and CI so multiple agents can work in different chats/branches

**Implemented**

- `husky` + `lint-staged` — pre-commit: format/fix staged files, then `pnpm check`
- Root scripts: `lint`, `lint:fix`, `typecheck`, `format`, `format:check`, `check`
- `typecheck` targets on BE, DOCS, dtos, qu-constants (FE already had vite plugin target)
- ESLint: `eslint-config-prettier`, ignore `.docusaurus` / build dirs
- Fixed `dtos` package.json missing `zod` dep (dependency-checks lint)
- Excluded root `quack-auth` Nx project from `run-many` to avoid recursive script loops

**Verified**

- [x] `pnpm check`

**Developer asked for (same session)**

- Rename **section id** → **session id** — one id per chat, not per topic arc; refer to the human as **Developer**
- Document **Husky** in DOCS — what the pre-commit hook runs (`lint-staged` + `pnpm check`), lint-staged globs, and manual `pnpm check` scripts (was missing from Docusaurus after implementation)

**Output that needed fixing**

- Husky landed in code + README + skills but **not** in `apps/DOCS` until Developer flagged it — added `setup/09-husky-quality-gates.md`, updated `intro.md`, maintenance tables, and doc skills/agents
- Developer ran `pnpm check` and hit `format:check` failure — `09-husky-quality-gates.md` and `docusaurus-docs/SKILL.md` were edited but not Prettier-formatted before commit; fixed with `prettier --write`
- Document **[filelinks](https://github.com/Vilancer/filelinks)** at the `app.dto.ts` sync warning — Developer-built tool linking trigger/affects files and directories for hooks/agents; README shows `pnpm add` but **not published on npm yet**
- Document **`filelinks check --run-agents`** — when a trigger is staged, filelinks can spawn a Cursor agent with a per-link prompt to fix affects (e.g. `createZodDto` wrappers); Developer asked to mention this explicitly
- Log **model with exact version** (e.g. Composer 2.5), not shorthand “Composer”
- Developer hit `EBADDEVENGINES` running `npx nx generate ci-workflow` — repo requires **pnpm**; Developer then ran **`pnpm nx generate ci-workflow --ci=github`** to scaffold `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Align **CI** with Husky — workflow customized so main step is `pnpm check` (not default `nx affected -t lint test build`); commented TODOs for **BE unit tests** and **FE E2E** when ready (E2E only if not too heavy)
- **PR open change summary** — Developer asked for main-branch email digest pattern adapted to PRs: `.github/workflows/pr-open-change-summary.yml` (renamed from bad “main change summary” naming), same Cursor agent provider, appends digest to **PR description** on `pull_request: opened` only (no Gmail)
- **CI Node version** — Developer reported CI failure: pnpm 11.5.2 on Node 20 → `ERR_UNKNOWN_BUILTIN_MODULE: node:sqlite`; fixed `ci.yml` to `node-version: 22`
- Developer added **`CURSOR_API_KEY`** to GitHub Actions repo secrets; documented in README (maintainers) and DOCS PR summary section
- Log **Cursor surface** (`Editor` \| `Agents`) per session; note all `AI.md` work through `S006` was **Editor** — setup is highest priority; Developer shifting to **Agents** window for efficient multi-chat / multi-branch work
- Developer noted CI was missing **build** — added `pnpm build` / `pnpm ci` (`check` + `build`); `ci.yml` now runs `pnpm ci` (Husky still `check` only)
- Before **Agents** window: **one branch per chat** (`quack-XX-<feature>`); `@commitlint/cli` + `@commitlint/config-conventional` + `.commitlintrc.json` + Husky `commit-msg`; Developer prefers `feat:` / `fix:` / `docs:` / `test:` prefixes

---

## Session entry timestamps

**Heading format (required):** `## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — Short title` — local **24-hour** time, not date-only.

The Developer flagged that agents **stopped including `HH:MM`** in headings after early sessions (e.g. `S001` at `18:30`). Rule: `.cursor/rules/ai-first-engineering.mdc` — **AI.md timestamps** section.

- New entries: always `HH:MM` in the heading.
- Backfill: add time only when known; otherwise keep date in heading and set **`Local start time`** — _not recorded at session start_.

## How to extend this file

After each significant AI-assisted session, append:

- **Heading** — `## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — Short title` (see **Session entry timestamps** above)
- **Session id** (`S###-slug`) — one id per chat; reuse for all entries from the same conversation
- **Cursor surface** — `Editor` or `Agents`
- **Branch** — e.g. `quack-07-auth-login` (optional but recommended for Agents chats)
- **Local start time** (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`) — repeat in body when useful
- **Model** — full product name + version (e.g. Composer 2.5, Claude Opus 4.6)
- **Chat summary** — `No`, or `Yes` + `### Chat summary — YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` block if context was compacted

Template: see **How to extend this file** above; policy in `.cursor/rules/ai-first-engineering.mdc`.

## 2026-06-08 — AGENTS.md indexes rules (Developer request)

**Session** — `S007-user-model` (conventions doc refactor)

**Local start time** — not recorded at session start

**Developer asked for**

- **`AGENTS.md` = index only** — pointers to `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, not duplicated convention text.
- **`.cursor/rules/project-conventions.mdc` = source of truth** for coding/layout conventions; on new convention → update rule first, then one-line pointer in AGENTS.md.
- Complete **skills → rules** migration (`ai-first-engineering`, `ai-first-subagent`, `docusaurus-docs`); log Developer mistake using `/create-skill` instead of `/create-rule`.

**Implemented**

- Rewrote `AGENTS.md` as layout table + rules index + artifacts table.
- Expanded `project-conventions.mdc` with full DTO/Mongoose detail moved from AGENTS.md; added source-of-truth header and update workflow.
- `ai-first-engineering.mdc` step 0: new conventions → project-conventions + AGENTS pointer.
- Empty `.cursor/skills/*/` dirs removed (SKILL.md files already gone; content lives in `.mdc` rules).

## 2026-06-08 — `/simplify` + `/code-review` on `quack-02-user-model`

**Session** — `S008-simplify-review`

**Local start time** — not recorded at session start

**Cursor surface** — Agents

**Branch** — `quack-02-user-model` (diff vs `main`)

**Developer asked for**

- Run **`/simplify`** and **`/code-review`** on this branch/PR against `main`; log outcome in `AI.md`.

**What the commands do**

- **`/simplify`** — read-only pass for unnecessary complexity (duplication, dead code, weak abstractions), then targeted fixes that preserve behavior.
- **`/code-review`** — read-only pass for bugs, regressions, security, missing tests; report by severity; fix only clear in-scope issues.

**Key findings**

## 2026-06-08 — Babysit PR #3 (`/babysit` first use)

**Session** — `S007-babysit-pr`

**Local start time** — not recorded at session start

**Cursor surface** — Agents

**Branch** — `quack-02-user-model`

**Model** — Composer 2.5 (babysit subagent via ai-first-engineering delegate)

**Chat summary** — No

**Developer asked for**

- **First use of `/babysit`** — keep [PR #3](https://github.com/malekelkssas/quack-auth/pull/3) merge-ready.

**What babysit does** (for future sessions)

Get a PR to **merge-ready**: check PR status, comments, and CI; resolve merge conflicts with main when behind; triage unresolved review comments (including Bugbot) and fix valid issues; fix CI failures in PR scope (not by weakening workflows); push scoped fixes and re-watch until **mergeable + green**.

**Babysit outcome**

| Check          | Result                                                      |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Merge state    | `CLEAN` — mergeable, no conflicts with `main`               |
| CI             | Green — `main` (pnpm ci) + `Cursor digest → PR description` |
| Review threads | None (no Bugbot or human review comments)                   |
| Local branch   | Clean working tree on `quack-02-user-model`                 |

**Actions taken**

- Inspected PR via `gh pr view`, `gh pr checks`, GraphQL review threads — no fixes required.
- No push (nothing to change).

**PR merge-ready** — Yes.

The Developer was running **multi-chat / parallel agent work** (separate branches per chat) from the **Agents** window. [PR #3](https://github.com/malekelkssas/quack-auth/pull/3) on `quack-02-user-model` landed in that plan alongside other in-flight chats.

**What happened**

After work on `quack-02-user-model`, the Developer noticed the AI had **not** updated `AI.md` for those changes. Related gaps surfaced at the same time: **mongoose/dtos conventions** lived in rules but were **not** reflected in `apps/DOCS` (later mirrored in `S008-convention-docs`), and other convention/doc sync issues disrupted the parallel plan.

**Developer judgement call**

Rather than continue parallel feature work on a shaky foundation, the Developer **destroyed/abandoned** the in-progress PR/branch **`quack-02-fe-setup`** and redirected effort to **conventions and documentation** (see `S007-user-model` — `project-conventions.mdc`, `AGENTS.md` index, skills→rules migration).

**Impact**

A **slight delay** in the Developer’s planned parallel agent workflow — one chat/branch (`quack-02-fe-setup`) was dropped so convention and logging hygiene could catch up before resuming multi-branch feature work.

## 2026-06-08 — Mongoose / DTO convention docs gap

**Session** — `S008-convention-docs`

**Local start time** — not recorded at session start

**Cursor surface** — Agents (subagent)

**Model** — Composer 2.5

**Developer flagged**

- Mongoose domain layout (`*.schema.ts`, `*.model.ts`, `*.paths.ts`) and DTO suffix conventions (`.model.ts` vs `.dto.ts`, domain folders) were defined in `.cursor/rules/project-conventions.mdc` and `AGENTS.md` but **not** mirrored in Docusaurus setup docs.

**What was missing**

- `07-mongodb.md` / `apps/mongodb.md` — only top-level `mongoose/` tree; no per-domain three-file pattern or `*.paths.ts` rationale.
- `05-shared-libraries.md` — flat `greeting.dto.ts` example only; no domain folders or `.model.ts` / `.dto.ts` split.
- `libs/dtos/README.md` — Nx boilerplate only.

**Docs added**

- `apps/DOCS/docs/setup/07-mongodb.md` — §7d domain model layout + link to `project-conventions.mdc`; Docker renumbered to §7e.
- `apps/DOCS/docs/apps/mongodb.md` — domain folders summary + cross-link to setup.
- `apps/DOCS/docs/setup/05-shared-libraries.md` — DTO domain folders, suffix table, NestJS wrapper pointer.
- `apps/DOCS/docs/ai/maintenance.md` — maintenance table rows for Mongoose/DTO conventions.

**Source of truth** — `.cursor/rules/project-conventions.mdc` (agents); DOCS are the human-facing mirror.

## 2026-06-08 21:31 — Restore AI.md session timestamps

**Session** — `S010-ai-md-timestamps`

**Local start time** — `2026-06-08 21:31`

**Cursor surface** — Agents

**Model** — Composer 2.5

**Developer asked for**

- Agents had **stopped logging `HH:MM`** in `AI.md` session headings after early entries (e.g. `S001` at `18:30`); later entries used date-only headings.
- Document the requirement in **`.cursor/rules/ai-first-engineering.mdc`** and note the Developer flagged it.
- Backfill times where known; mark _not recorded_ elsewhere.

**Implemented**

- Added **AI.md timestamps** section to `ai-first-engineering.mdc` (heading format `## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — …`).
- Added **Session entry timestamps** section to this file’s template.
- Backfilled **`Local start time`** on date-only sessions (`S005`–`S009`); `S001` heading already had `18:30`.

## 2026-06-08 21:33 — Revert invalid `user.fields.ts` (DTO convention)

**Session** — `S011-dto-fields-revert`

**Local start time** — `2026-06-08 21:33`

**Cursor surface** — Agents

**Model** — Composer 2.5

**Developer steered**

- During `S008-simplify-review`, AI introduced **`libs/dtos/src/lib/user/user.fields.ts`** (`UserEmail`, `UserName`) to dedupe Zod rules between `signup.dto.ts` and `user.model.ts`.
- The Developer **never defined** a `.fields.ts` suffix. Valid DTO layout is **`.model.ts`** (persisted mirror) and **`.dto.ts`** (flow/API) per domain folder — see `.cursor/rules/project-conventions.mdc`.
- Shared blocks inside a domain (e.g. `password.schema.ts`) are fine when multiple DTOs need the same rules; a new suffix is not.

**Fixed**

- Deleted `user.fields.ts`.
- Restored inline `email` / `name` validation in `user.model.ts` and `signup.dto.ts` as before the simplify pass.

## 2026-06-08 22:10 — FE Redux store + encrypt-storage (Developer request)

**Session** — `S012-fe-redux-store`

**Local start time** — `2026-06-08 22:10` (continued from earlier turns in same chat)

**Cursor surface** — Agents

**Branch** — `quack-02-fe-setup`

**Model** — Composer 2.5

**Chat summary** — No

**Developer asked for**

- Checkout `quack-02-fe-setup` for deep FE work; install RTK + `react-redux` + `redux-persist` + `@types/react-redux`; add `VITE_REDUX_PERSIST_SECRET_KEY` to `.env.example` and `ENV_KEYS`; scaffold `apps/FE/src/store/`.
- **Research encrypt integration first** — Developer shared findings: `redux-persist-transform-encrypt` is abandoned; static `VITE_*` keys are bundled and give false security; prefer runtime auth token or `encrypt-storage` as redux-persist storage engine.
- **Log this in `AI.md`** — Developer flagged that prior FE work skipped `AI.md`; update `AGENTS.md` so agents do not forget the logging rule.

**Implemented**

- Installed `@reduxjs/toolkit`, `react-redux`, `redux-persist`, `encrypt-storage`, `@types/react-redux`.
- **Skipped** `redux-persist-transform-encrypt` (archived Feb 2024); used **`encrypt-storage`** `AsyncEncryptStorage` as redux-persist `storage` with `stateManagementUse: true`.
- `apps/FE/src/store/` — `persist-secret.ts` (`getDevPersistSecretKey`, `setRuntimePersistSecretKey` for future JWT/session key), `encrypted-storage.ts`, `persist.config.ts`, `root-reducer.ts`, `store.ts`, `hooks.ts`, `index.ts`.
- `main.tsx` — `Provider` + `PersistGate` (loading placeholder until ProgressLoader lands in follow-up commit).
- `.env.example` + `libs/qu-constants/src/lib/env.constants.ts` — `VITE_REDUX_PERSIST_SECRET_KEY` with comment that it is dev obfuscation only.

**Decisions different from Developer’s initial package list**

| Developer listed                  | Chosen                                        | Why                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `redux-persist-transform-encrypt` | `encrypt-storage`                             | Original archived; storage-level encryption is the maintained redux-persist integration path |
| Static `VITE_` key as “security”  | Dev fallback + `setRuntimePersistSecretKey()` | `VITE_*` is in client bundle; real key should be runtime session/JWT when auth exists        |

**Verified**

- [x] `pnpm nx run FE:typecheck`

**Developer asked for (same session, next)**

- Commit Redux work; then shadcn scaffold (`apps/FE/src/components/ui`, `@/lib/utils.ts`); `ProgressLoader` on `PersistGate` instead of `null` loading.

**Implemented (continued)**

- Committed `feat(FE): add Redux store with encrypted redux-persist` (`8fcd399`).
- shadcn scaffold: `apps/FE/components.json` (CLI-ready, `ui` → `@/components/ui`), `src/lib/utils.ts` (`cn`), empty `src/components/ui/`.
- Deps: `tailwind-merge`, `class-variance-authority`, `lucide-react`, `tailwindcss-animate`; Tailwind theme tokens + `--academic-blue` in `styles.css`.
- `ProgressLoader` at `src/components/ProgressLoader.tsx`; `PersistGate loading={<ProgressLoader />}`.

**Verified**

- [x] `pnpm nx run FE:typecheck` (shadcn + ProgressLoader)

## 2026-06-08 22:20 — FE axios client convention

**Session** — `S012-fe-redux-store` (same chat)

**Local start time** — `2026-06-08 22:20`

**Cursor surface** — Agents

**Branch** — `quack-02-fe-setup`

**Model** — Composer 2.5

**Developer asked for**

- Install **axios**; create FE convention; `apps/FE/src/api/axiosConfig.ts` only — keep it simple (no interceptors, domain modules, or env wiring yet); **log in `AI.md`**.

**Implemented**

- `pnpm add axios`.
- `apps/FE/src/api/axiosConfig.ts` — default-exported instance, JSON content-type (baseURL initially wrong — see fix below).
- Convention in `.cursor/rules/project-conventions.mdc` — single shared instance, no stray `axios.create()`, future `*.api.ts` + interceptors rules; one-line pointer in `AGENTS.md`.

**Output that needed fixing**

- **Hard-coded API `baseURL`** — AI set `http://localhost:3000/api` directly in `axiosConfig.ts` instead of `VITE_API_URL` + `ENV_KEYS`. Developer corrected immediately.

**Verified**

- [x] `pnpm nx run FE:typecheck`

## 2026-06-08 22:23 — Fix axios baseURL env (Developer correction)

**Session** — `S012-fe-redux-store` (same chat)

**Local start time** — `2026-06-08 22:23`

**Cursor surface** — Agents

**Branch** — `quack-02-fe-setup`

**Developer asked for**

- Replace hard-coded `baseURL` with **`VITE_API_URL`**; update `.env.example` and `libs/qu-constants/src/lib/env.constants.ts`; log the mistake.

**Fixed**

- `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api` in `.env.example`.
- `ENV_KEYS.VITE_API_URL` in `env.constants.ts`.
- `axiosConfig.ts` reads `import.meta.env[ENV_KEYS.VITE_API_URL]` with throw if missing.
- `project-conventions.mdc` — `baseURL` must come from `VITE_API_URL`, never hard-coded.

**Verified**

- [x] `pnpm nx run FE:typecheck`

## 2026-06-08 22:29 — Vite host env + FE build chunks

**Session** — `S012-fe-redux-store` (same chat)

**Local start time** — `2026-06-08 22:29`

**Cursor surface** — Agents

**Branch** — `quack-02-fe-setup`

**Developer asked for**

- Commit axios work; add `VITE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` + `VITE_HOST` to `.env.example` and `ENV_KEYS`; update `apps/FE/vite.config.mts` (server/preview host + `allowedHosts`, vendor chunk split) — **no** `@tailwindcss/vite` or `react-grab`.

**Implemented**

- Committed `feat(FE): add axios client with VITE_API_URL env` (`5e637f8`).
- `.env.example` — `VITE_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost`, `VITE_HOST=localhost` (comment notes `0.0.0.0` option).
- `vite.config.mts` — `process.env.VITE_HOST`, `VITE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` comma-split, `manualChunks` vendor split, `chunkSizeWarningLimit: 1000`.

**Output that needed fixing**

- **`manualChunks` object** — Vite 8 / Rolldown expects a **function**, not `{ vendor: [...] }`; converted to `manualChunks(id)` guard for react/react-dom.

**Verified**

- [x] `pnpm nx run FE:build`

## 2026-06-08 22:37 — FE Tailwind v3 → v4 migration

**Session** — `S012-fe-redux-store` (same chat)

**Local start time** — `2026-06-08 22:37`

**Cursor surface** — Agents

**Branch** — `quack-02-fe-setup`

**Model** — Composer 2.5 (Developer switched to **Plan mode** for migration planning; implementation resumed in Agent mode on a **different model/context handoff** from the planning turn)

**Chat summary** — No

**Developer asked for**

- Implement attached **FE Tailwind v4 Migration Plan** after committing pending vite-host work.
- Developer explicitly flipped assistant to **Plan mode** because migration is annoying/complex; requested **AI.md** note about Plan mode and **model switch**.
- Note that **Nx template ships Tailwind v3** — FE migrated to latest v4.

**Implemented**

- Committed `feat(FE): add Vite host env and build chunk tuning` (`b883208`) before migration.
- Deps: `tailwindcss@4.3.0`, `@tailwindcss/vite@4.3.0`, `tw-animate-css`; removed `tailwindcss@3.4.3`, `tailwindcss-animate`, `autoprefixer`.
- `apps/FE/vite.config.mts` — `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin (host/chunk settings preserved).
- `apps/FE/src/styles.css` — `@import "tailwindcss"`, `@import "tw-animate-css"`, `@custom-variant dark`, `@theme inline` shadcn tokens, `--academic-blue`, `animate-progress`.
- Removed `apps/FE/tailwind.config.js` and `apps/FE/postcss.config.js` (v4 CSS-first).
- `apps/FE/components.json` — `"config": ""` for shadcn v4 CLI.
- `ProgressLoader` — `var(--academic-blue)` + `animate-progress` token.
- Docs/conventions: `project-conventions.mdc`, `AGENTS.md`, `apps/DOCS/docs/setup/02-frontend.md`.

**Verified**

- [x] `pnpm nx run FE:typecheck`
- [x] `pnpm nx run FE:build`
